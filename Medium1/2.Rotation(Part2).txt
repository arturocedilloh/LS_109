# Given an number input_number that will be rotated and a number n which defines
#      the last n digits to be rotated
# Will use method rotate_array from first exercise.
# n is always positive
# number has more than 0 digits
# if number of digits rotated is 1, return number


CONVERT input_number into a string then an array called integer_array
IF n > 1 then
  SET front_array = array between first element and (-n -1) index of integer_array
  SET back_array = array between (-n) index and last element of integer_array
  SET new_array = return value of rotate_array when it is passed the back_array as an argument
  RETURN  front_array + new_array, join and converted to integer
ELSE
  RETURN input_number
